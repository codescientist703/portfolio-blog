Python is a powerful general programming language developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.  It is very easy to understand which makes it one of the best languages to start learning. Python is also the programming language that I would recommend everyone to learn especially if you are an absolute beginner in the world of programming. As of now, python is the second most sought after language in the world according to the TIOBE index. It is used in all sorts of areas like web development, artificial intelligence, data science etc. You can find many python programming tutorials online but this blog post compiles everything into one single guide. So if you are just starting as a beginner here is a step-by-step guide that will serve as a perfect entry point for you to grow your python programming skill. Let's get right into it!

## Step 1 - What motivates you to learn python ?

If you are starting to learn python without any type of real motivation it will become a boring process and chances are that you will drop midway. So it's very important to first decide what you want to do with it. This will make the learning process very much fun to follow and ultimately the journey itself will be more rewarding than the goal. Here are the general areas that you might be interested in -

* Data Science
* Machine Learning
* IoT (Robotics, Hardware)
